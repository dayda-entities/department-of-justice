The purpose of this study was to answer the following research questions: (1) Do domestic violence courts reduce recidivism?; (2) Do domestic violence courts hold defendants accountable through the use of more severe case outcomes and sentences?; (3) What, if any, court-level policies make these courts more or less effective (e.g., related to eligibility, program mandates, compliance monitoring, or victim service)?; (4) What, if any community characteristics make these courts more or less effective (e.g., related to population size, racial composition, or socioeconomic characteristics)?; (5) Based on individual characteristics (e.g., age, criminal history, or current charges), which categories of defendants are at a high risk of re-offending; and are certain categories particularly responsive to the domestic violence court intervention?
