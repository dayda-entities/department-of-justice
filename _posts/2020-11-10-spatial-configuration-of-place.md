The purpose of this research was to further understanding of why crime occurs where it does by exploring the spatial etiology of homicides that occurred in Washington, DC, between 1990 and 2002. This research sought to fill a gap in the criminological literature by (1) disaggregating homicides by motive to provide a more exact analysis of movement for each particular type; (2) exploring the distances to homicide for victims and offenders; (3) describing the relationships between victims, offenders, and places through a comparison of two mobility triangle typologies; and (4) applying various cartographic methods for representing the interactions between victim, offender, and place.
