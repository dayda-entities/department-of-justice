This project addressed two major goals in a sample of adolescent girls in the child welfare system in the Denver, Colorado metro area. First, researchers compared the effectiveness of two interventions for revictimization among adolescent girls in the child welfare system using a randomized, longitudinal design. Second, researchers examined process variables targeted by the respective interventions longitudinally.
