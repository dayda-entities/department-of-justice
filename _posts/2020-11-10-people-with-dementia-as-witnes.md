The study sought evidence that a subset of people with dementia (PwD) has reliable memory for emotional events in their own lives, and they differ from PwD whose memory for emotional life events is less reliable or unreliable in respect to their own disease stage, confabulation and neuropsychiatric behaviors, and awareness of their cognitive impairment. In addition and in the context of a structured interview, they can provide (hypothetically) more details related to memories for emotional life events and discuss the events with the same accuracy after a time delay.
