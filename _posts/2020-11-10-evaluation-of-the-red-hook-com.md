The study examined four research questions:

Was the Red Hook Community Justice Center (RHCJC) implemented according to plan?
Did RHCJC make a difference in sanctioning, recidivism, and arrests?
How did RHCJC produce any observed reductions to recidivism and arrests?
Is RHCJC cost-efficient from the viewpoint of taxpayers?
