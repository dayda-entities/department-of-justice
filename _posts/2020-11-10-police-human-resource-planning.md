The purpose of this study was to update the understanding of the practice of human resource (HR) planning in policing by administering surveys to a small expert panel and to a much larger number of law enforcement officials, human resource professionals, academic criminal justice faculty, and university criminal justice students. The surveys sought information about current human resource practices, current challenges, career orientations of students (potential employees), and perspectives on what is working well, what is not, and what interested parties think should be changed. Also, mini-case studies on current HR issues and practices were collected from individuals with direct knowledge.
