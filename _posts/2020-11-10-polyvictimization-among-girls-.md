The purpose of this study was not only to understand different types of girls' exposure to multiple forms of victimization, but to also understand factors such as trajectory of risk over the lifespan, dependence of different forms of exposure, and ways that cumulative impacts influence life outcomes. This study used lifespan data on girls' victimization and juvenile offending to: examine range, diversity, and co-occurrence of different types of violence over the course of girls' lives
