The purpose of the study was to examine the following four broad research questions: (1) Are race/ethnic differences in drug arrests explained by race/ethnic differences in drug use, drug sales, non-drug offending, and/or dwelling in high crime neighborhoods? (2) Does drug arrest reduce the likelihood of subsequent drug offending (i.e., drug use, drug sales)? (3) Does arrest negatively affect bonds to employment, education, and marriage? (4) Does the effect of drug arrest on subsequent drug offending and social bonding vary by race/ethnicity?
