This study had two purposes. The first purpose was to explore whether bullied students engage in specific protective behaviors that inhibit learning, put other students' safety at risk, or foster a negative school climate. Such behaviors were defined as avoidance (of places or individuals), truancy, physical fighting, and weapon carrying. The second purpose was to explore whether bullied students' behaviors varied by the type of bullying (direct, verbal, indirect, or cyber) endured.
