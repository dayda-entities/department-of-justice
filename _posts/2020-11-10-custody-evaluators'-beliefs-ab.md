The purpose of this study was to better understand the beliefs of child custody evaluators and related professionals regarding allegations of domestic abuse made by parents during the divorce process.Â The study also sought to conduct in-depth interviews with domestic abuse survivors who experienced negative custody-visitation outcomes to help interpret the quantitative findings, uncover new areas of concern and learn of recommendations the survivors had for changing the custody determination process.
