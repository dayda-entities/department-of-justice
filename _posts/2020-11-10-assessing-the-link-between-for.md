The primary purpose of this project was to evaluate the possible link between foreclosure and crime in America. The project addressed three specific questions: (1) Are levels of foreclosure significantly associated with crime rates across neighborhoods after controlling for other factors?; (2) Is any observed effect of foreclosure on neighborhood crime rates contingent on (i.e., moderated by) other neighborhood conditions, including pre-existing structural disadvantage, pre-existing vacancy rates, or racial and ethnic context?; and (3) Does the effect of foreclosure rates on neighborhood crime levels vary across cities in systematic ways?
