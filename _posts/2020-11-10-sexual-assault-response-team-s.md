The purpose of Study 1 National Survey was to conduct a national-scale study of Sexual Assault Response Teams (SARTs) in order to:

Understand the structure and functioning of United States SARTs.
Identify patterns of SART implementation.
Examine how these different patterns relate to perceived effectiveness at improvements in legal practice and outcomes.
The purpose of Study 2 Network Analysis was to examine patterns of collaborative relationships within model SARTs:

To understand the nature and distribution of each of these types of inter-organizational relationships within model SARTs. For example, are SARTs characterized by many or few inter-organizational relationships? Do organizations in SARTs tend to have relationships that are reciprocated? Are relationships centered around a focal organization or group of organizations?
To understand the associations between these types of inter-organizational relationships. In other words, within SARTs, do inter-organizational relationships tend to be similar across networks of communication frequency, feeling valued by other organizations, and valuing other organizations' work?
