The study had two primary goals. The first was to provide a reliable and ethnographically rich description of the local commercial sexually exploited children (CSEC) population, including its size, characteristics, experiences, and service needs. The second was to evaluate the local demonstration project, documenting its major initiatives, achievements, and obstacles.Â
