The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of a multi-level longitudinal approach to dating violence and harassment prevention and intervention programming for public middle school students from New York City (NYC). Specifically, whether the Shifting Boundaries (SB) program was of sufficient dosage to produce sustained effects post intervention beyond the six months demonstrated in a previous wave of the study. Second, if schools could implement the SB program in just one grade to conserve resources but still achieve DV/H reduction effects.
