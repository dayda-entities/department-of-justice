The purpose of the impact evaluation was to gauge the success of the victim's rights clinics in attaining each of the following goals: (1) Aid in enforcing rights for individual victims and getting them help for crime-related needs, thereby increasing satisfaction of victims with the justice process; (2) Change attitudes of criminal justice officials towards victims' rights and increase their knowledge about rights; (3) Change the legal landscape: establish victim standing and develop positive case law; (4) Increase compliance of criminal justice officials with victims' rights; and (5) Sustain the clinic through developing alternative sources of funding
